Welcome to the developer site for the Analysis Exchange (AE), an effort guided by the industry consortium [Analytic Technology Industry Roundtable](http://technologyroundtable.org).  As the name implies the Exchange is a set of design patterns and ontologies for exchanging data between analytic solutions. There are limits to these ideas and technologies and the emphasis should be on the partnerships between organizations that partake in the mission where the analysis occurs. As a developer, domain analyst, integrator or visionary you have a role as a part of a team where ideas like the AE would be used.  The projects here are examplars of that partnership so far -- The AE debuts November 2017.

First, if you have not already read the foreword material, see these overview documents
* [Analysis Exchange Model 1.0 Software Design](http://technologyroundtable.org/pdfs/Analysis-Exchange-Model1-Design-2017.pdf)
* [Understanding the Impact of the Analysis Exchange Model 1.0](http://technologyroundtable.org/pdfs/AE-Impact-Whitepape.pdf)
* ["Why Work with the Roundtable?"](http://technologyroundtable.org/pdfs/Why-Work-With-The-Roundtable.pdf) and
  ["Harnessing the Power of Partnerships to Advance Data Analytics"](http://technologyroundtable.org/pdfs/Roundtable2.pdf)

Technical Materials
===================
This site provides technical documents, use cases and reference implementations that embody the Analysis Exchange.  From the design document above, the next logical items to digest is the ontologies and then the use cases to see how they are applied.  All of this is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/Analytic-Roundtable.  These resources are also summarized in a [flyer](http://technologyroundtable.org/pdfs/Roundtable-Resources.pdf)

* [Upper Ontology for the Analysis Exchange Model 1.0](https://github.com/Analytic-Roundtable/Analysis-Exchange/doc/AnalysisExchange-Upper-Ontology-2017.pdf)
* [Domain Ontology for the Analysis Exchange Model 1.0](https://github.com/Analytic-Roundtable/Analysis-Exchange/doc/AnalysisExchange-Domain-Ontologies-2017.pdf)
* [Adaptation Guide for Analysis Exchange Model 1.0](https://github.com/Analytic-Roundtable/Analysis-Exchange/doc)
* The three use cases exhibited in the Model 1.0 debut are described in this 
  [flyer](http://technologyroundtable.org/pdfs/Roundtable-Three-Use-Cases.pdf).

These Use Case projects are available in full here:
UseCase-FraudWasteAbuse
* **Fraud, Waste and Abuse:** analyze travel vouchers for potential fraud.  The reference implementation of the AE Model 1.0 is featured in this project. \[[Project](https://github.com/Analytic-Roundtable/UseCase-FraudWasteAbuse)\] \[[Description](https://github.com/Analytic-Roundtable/UseCase-FraudWasteAbuse/blob/master/Travel-Voucher-and-MedicalClaims-UseCase-v4.pdf)\]
* **Threat Assessment:** assess public domain data for regions with security concerns.
